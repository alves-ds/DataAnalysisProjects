# About this document

Welcome! This document represents one of my projects as a beginner data scientist. In this project, I take on the role of a junior data analyst tasked with a project for a fictitious company. 

# Project Overview
**Business task:**  Analyzing data from a company to identify distribution differences in socioeconomic variables, as well as whether the workers' salaries are influenced by these variables.

## Key Questions:
The key questions will be highlighted throughout the document.

# Data for this project
The data for this project is not publicly available.

# Loading packages
First, let's load the packages we will need for the data analysis.

``` {python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp
from statsmodels.stats.anova import AnovaRM
```

# Loading dataset
``` {python}
dados = pd.read_spss('dados_lista1.sav')
``` 

## Let's have a look in our data
``` {python}
dados.head()
``` 

We have a database with 36 workers in a company. Let's conduct an exploratory analysis based on pre-established questions.

## Question 1 - Plot frequency tables for data relating to level of education, marital status and region of origin

For this, let's use the 'crosstab' method from pandas

``` {python}
frequency_table = pd.crosstab(dados['grau_de'], 'count')
``` 

Let's compute a variable to see the relative proportions

``` {python}
frequency_table['percentage'] = frequency_table/len(dados)
``` 

To improve the interpretation, let's multiply the relative proportion by 100
``` {python}
frequency_table['percentage'] = frequency_table['percentage']*100
``` 

Let's have a look at our frequency table
``` {python}
frequency_table
``` 

We can see that the greater proportion of individuals from this company have a second degree qualification.

Now, let's do the same for the other categorical variables

``` {python}
frequency_marital = pd.crosstab(dados['estado_c'], 'count')

frequency_marital['percentage'] = frequency_marital/len(dados)*100

frequency_marital

frequency_origin_region = pd.crosstab(dados['origem'], 'count')

frequency_origin_region['percentage'] = frequency_origin_region/len(dados)*100

frequency_origin_region
``` 

## Question 2 - Graph the above tables
Let's do it using subplots. 

``` {python}
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(9, 6), sharey=True)
ax1.bar(frequency_table.index, frequency_table['percentage'])
ax1.set_ylabel('Proportion of total sample')
ax2.bar(frequency_origin_region.index, frequency_origin_region['percentage'])
ax3.bar(frequency_marital.index, frequency_marital['percentage'])
plt.show()
```

## Question 3 - Compare, statistically (α=5%), whether there are differences in the distribution of the number of children and the average age depending on the regions of origin of the workers

First, as a prerequisite for using tests based on the arithmetic mean (such as ANOVA or t-test), let's examine the distribution of our dependent variables (age and number of children) using histograms.

``` {python}
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(9, 4))
ax1.hist(dados['idade'])
ax1.set_ylabel('Idade (anos)')
ax2.hist(dados['n_mero_d'])
ax2.set_ylabel('Número de filhos')
plt.show()
```

We can note an asymmetric distribution for both variables, but let's compare these variables using analysis of variance.


``` {python}
anova_age = f_oneway(dados['idade'][dados['origem'] == 'Interior'],
                     dados['idade'][dados['origem'] == 'Capital'],
                     dados['idade'][dados['origem'] == 'Outro'])

anova_childs = f_oneway(dados['n_mero_d'][dados['origem'] == 'Interior'],
                     dados['n_mero_d'][dados['origem'] == 'Capital'],
                     dados['n_mero_d'][dados['origem'] == 'Outro'])

anova_age
anova_childs

``` 

For both tests it was not possible to see any effect of origin!

## Question 4 - Calculate the average salary and average age of single and married people

``` {python}
age_marital = dados.groupby('estado_c')['idade'].describe()
salary_marital = dados.groupby('estado_c')['sal_rio1'].describe()

age_marital
salary_marital
``` 


## Question 5 - Check the association between marital status and level of education. Is it possible to say that there is a significant association between marital status and level of education (α=5%)?

To test this association, let's use a chi-square test.

First, let's calculate the contingency table

``` {python}
contingency_marital_edu = pd.crosstab(dados['estado_c'], dados['grau_de'])
``` 

Now let's to apply the test to our contingency table

``` {python}
chi2, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(contingency_marital_edu)
``` 


Let's see the contingency table

``` {python}
contingency_marital_edu
``` 

Let's see the p value of our chi-square test

``` {python}
p_value
``` 

Based on the p-value we can see that there is not a relationship between marital status and level of education. 

## Question 6 - According to IBGE data, the average age of the population of SP is 31 years old. Does the sample presented have a significant difference in mean age in relation to the population mean estimate?


To answer this question, let's use a one-sample t test

``` {python}
age_one_sample_t_test = ttest_1samp(dados['idade'], 31)
age_one_sample_t_test
``` 

By means of a one-sample t-test, it is possible to see a significant difference (p = 0.003) between the age of our sample and the population mean, with a mean difference of 3.58 years.


## Question 7 - The salary of this sample was measured in three consecutive years (06,07 and 08). Was there a difference between the salary over time? (α=5%).

First, let's have a look into the distribution of our data in the 3 different times

``` {python}
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(16, 5))
ax1.hist(dados['sal_rio'])
ax1.set_ylabel('Salary (first measure)')
ax2.hist(dados['sal_rio1'])
ax2.set_ylabel('Salary (second measure)')
ax3.hist(dados['sal_rio2'])
ax3.set_ylabel('Salary (third measure)')
plt.show()
``` 

We can see that our measures aren't symmetric, but we will use a repeated measures ANOVA to compare the means of the three different measures.

First, we need to convert our data from the wide to the long format. So, let's do it:

``` {python}
dados = dados.reset_index()
dados_long = pd.melt(dados, id_vars='index', value_vars=['sal_rio', 'sal_rio1', 'sal_rio2'])
``` 

Now, We need to create a variable to indicate the repeated measures.

First, let's create this variable into our dataframe
``` {python}
dados_long['measure'] = None
``` 

Now let's use a for loop to put values into this new variable

``` {python}
for index,row in dados_long.iterrows():
    if row['variable'] == 'sal_rio':
        dados_long.at[index, 'measure'] = 1
    elif row['variable'] == 'sal_rio1':
        dados_long.at[index, 'measure'] = 2
    elif row['variable'] == 'sal_rio2':
        dados_long.at[index, 'measure'] = 3
```

Let's see the result of this process
``` {python}
dados_long.head()
```

Now, let's fit the repeated measures ANOVA:

``` {python}
RM_anova = AnovaRM(dados_long, depvar='value', subject='index', within=['measure']).fit()
``` 

Now let's see the result from our repeated measures ANOVA
``` {python}
RM_anova.anova_table
``` 

Based in the ANOVA we cannot see any effect of time upon salary. 

## Question 8 - Pay attention to the variable “Number of children”. Calculate the z-score for each participant in the sample. Which participants can be considered outliers for the number of children sample?

We already have the z-score in our database, so, let's check if there are some individual considered as outlier using a for loop. 

``` {python}
for index, row in dados.iterrows():
    if row['Zn_mero_d'] > 3 or row['Zn_mero_d'] < -3:
        print(row['index'])
```

Based in this approach we can see that the individual 30 can be considered as an outlier.
